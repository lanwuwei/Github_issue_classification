It was probably introduced from seed that was brought over on mining equipment from western Canada, since the mine owners had mines out west too and would have brought equipment over from there (according the the geologist I was with).  I sent photos of the plant to Kenton Chambers (who worked on Crepis) and he verified the ID.  The plant looks very much like Crepis nana, except that the flower occur on elongate, open panicles.  Chambers said the habitat where I found the plant - loose gravels from mining refuse, is similar to the river gravels of it's natural habitat.  We didn't find any outside of this mine site.   I have several specimens collected and lots of pix.\r\n\r\n<b>If applicable, please provide an authoritative source.</b>\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-04-10T22:10:11Z","org":{"id":1469762,"login":"Canadensys","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/Canadensys","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1469762?"}}

This is tested with Angular 1.5.1 and UI Router 0.2.18\r\n\r\nConsider this scenario:\r\n- **root state** is an abstract state that dynamically loads (through a resolve) the current user's profile. This resolve is injected into direct child states to make sure they're not instanciated before the profile is finished loading\r\n- **child state 1**'s own resolve checks if the user is registered. If so, the resolve is rejected and the user redirected to **child state 2**\r\n- **child state 2**'s own resolve checks if the user is _not_ registered. If so, the resolve is rejected and the user redirected to **child state 1**\r\n\r\nSo, in effect: **child state 1** is my \"visitors only\" zone while **child state 2** is my \"members only\" zone.\r\n\r\nNow, assume I am a registered user. When I first launch the app, here's what happens:\r\n\r\n1. **root state** is resolved, my user profile is loaded\r\n2. **child state 1**'s resolve is rejected (since I'm a member) and I am redirected to **child state 2**\r\n3. **root state** is resolved again! (and the API to load the profile is called again...)\r\n4. **child state 2**' is resolved and successfully activated\r\n\r\nIn my understanding, step 3 shouldn't happen -- **root**'s already been resolved previously and should not be resolved gain. Or am I getting something wrong?\r\n\r\nNote this only happens on the app's initial launch; if I try to navigate to **state 1** (eg. by clicking an `ui-sref`), then only **state 1**'s resolve is tested and correctly rejected without **root state** being resolved again.\r\n\r\nI've made a Plunker to demonstrate: https://plnkr.co/edit/Nne19FArvUf0W4JHOtB7"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2016-09-22T20:05:28Z","org":{"id":1530011,"login":"angular-ui","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/angular-ui","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1530011?"}}
